Analyzing Profitable App Profiles in Google Play and Apple Store
In this project, we are hired as a Data Analyst for a company that makes applications in Andriod and iOS. We only make free to install english applications. We make revenue out of our applications through in-app ads which means the more user that we have that sees and engages in ads, the more revenue that we get.

Our goal for this project is to analyze applications from Apple Store and Google Play Store that are English, Free-to-use apps to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users hence, we will look at three different factors of a succesfull app, namely:

Number of Installs
Number of Reviews
Number of Apps in that genre
Summary of Results
After careful cleaning, prepping and analysis, the two factors we heavily focused on is Number of Installs and Number of Reviews since we found no evidence of Number of Apps in that genre that are linked to being profitable. All the findings for a popular and profitable apps that we get have more installs and reviews which are connected to our goal.

We decided to invest in Gaming App since this genre has the least skew of installs and reviews from tech giants unlike Social Networking and Communication Apps. Also, Gaming Genre has a wide sub-genre within it which means more genres to explore hence we will give this analysis to the devs to decide what genre of games will be achievable for them.
